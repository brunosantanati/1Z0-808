/*
 * int can be converted to double but Integer type can't be converted 
 * to Double type as Integer and Double are siblings (both extends from Number class) 
 * so can't be casted to each other.
 * 
 * add(10.0, new Integer(10)); => 1st parameter is tagged to double primitive type and 
 * 2nd parameter is converted to int, is tagged to double primitive type as well. 
 * So, add(double, double); method is invoked.
