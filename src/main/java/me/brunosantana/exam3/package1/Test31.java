/*
Please note that Strings computed by concatenation at compile time, will be referred by String Pool 
during execution. Compile time String concatenation happens when both of the operands are compile time 
constants, such as literal, final variable etc.

Whereas, Strings computed by concatenation at run time (if the resultant expression is not constant 
expression) are newly created and therefore distinct.


For the statement, String str1 = i1 + s1;, i1 is a final variable of int type and s1 is a final 
variable of String type. Hence, `i1 + s1` is a constant expression which is computed at compile-time 
and results in String literal "1:ONE".

This means during compilation, Java compiler translates the statement

String str1 = i1 + s1;

to

String str1 = "1:ONE";

As "1:ONE" is a String literal, hence at runtime it will be referred by String Pool.


On the other hand, for the statement, String str2 = i2 + s1;, `i2 + s1` is not a constant expression 
because i2 is neither of primitive type nor of String type, hence it is computed at run-time and 
returns a non-pool String object "1:ONE".


As, str1 refers to String Pool object "1:ONE", hence `str1 == "1:ONE"` returns true, 
whereas str2 refers to non-Pool String object "1:ONE" and hence `str2 == "1:ONE"` returns false.
